found that some sample code can't run on Jupyter notebook because it is not compatible with Python 3.6 and thus need to 
install Python 2.7 and create two kernels to run the code.
Ipython 6 doesn't support Python 3, so need to download and install Ipython 5 
  pip install Ipython==5.0 --user
create kernel ipykernel_py2 for python 2
  conda create -n ipykernel_py2 python=2 ipykernel
activate it 
source activate ipykernel_py2
install pyspark
  pip install pyspark
link pyspark to Jupyter notebook
 export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=jupyter
 export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS='notebook'
 
 
 environment location: /anaconda3/envs/ipykernel_py2
